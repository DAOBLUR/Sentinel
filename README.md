### Problematic

Currently in many parts of Latin America we are facing a wave of crime that is beginning to get out of control. In Ecuador, for example, the presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated.
In Peru, criminal gangs, made up of Venezuelans, have taken control of the streets which are almost impassable at night.
Unfortunately the police don't help much, although it's not entirely their fault.
